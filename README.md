# I Learned Stuff

I have an unfortunate habit of learning new things every day and reaching the end of the week feeling that I haven't achieved enough. So I made this...thing to easily log my progress via the command line. Now I just need to remember to use it.

This does now work, at least insofar as it saves a json object containing a message (what was learned) and some optional user-defined tags.

## Future plans
- Storing the log objects in a database of some sort.
